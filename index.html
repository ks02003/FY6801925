  this article focuses on the variance in techniques used to prevent damage to infrastructure during natural hazards 
  such as earthquakes. The differences in the techniques and which one has the most successful and beneficial outcome 
  for the cause. Focus on how these mechanisms function to keep a building standing during an earthquake. overall modern
  technology is reliable due to the large success reate, however not all technology can work for every impact caused by 
  an earthquake. different technqiues such as base isolation and energy dissipation act to protect the building in
  ways. however if we combine these technqiues we increase the overall reliability of the technology.

earthquakes can happen at many magnitudes, and some can be extremely damaging to infrastructure. Techniques have been 
put in place which can help the building withstand the force of an earthquake. However, some techniques are more efficient 
than others and use different mechanisms to keep a building stable. New and advanced earthquake resistant technologies tend 
to be expensive, and countries of greater wealth are usually able to invest in this technology. They are heavily used in countries 
such as Japan and China where earthquakes are quite frequent, and countries are wealthy enough to afford this technology.

        <pre>
A range of techniques are usually used at a time to porrect against various impacts caused by an earthquake. 
Two important techniques that are used: Base isolation, energy dissipation devices. Both techniques are
commonly used as a strategy.
         
Base isolation: a series of bearing pads which are situated between the building itself and the foundations on which they sit. 
Bearing pads are sturdy in the vertical direction but leave room for movement in the horizontal direction. 
In the event of an earthquake the building can then move with the earthquake rather than against it.
         
Energy dissipation: energy gained by the building from the earthquake is dissipated through damping. 
Although the infrastructure can dissipate some energy on its own its capacity isn’t high enough and the building 
will collapse. To solve this, extra elements such as beams and columns are added. 
         
A wide range of dissipators have been developed, friction damps, metallic dampers, viscoelastic dampers, viscous dampers. 
Having a range of dampers can be beneficial as they act to different scenarios so using a diverse mix can increase the 
amount of energy dissipated making it more effective overall. 
       
Figure 1 shows that the more damping that occurs the slower the amplitude. If the amplitude of the shaking od a building is
decreased, then the less likely the building is to collapse as it is more stable.
         
These two techniques are heavily relied upon in protecting a countries infrastructure from natural hazards. However, hazards 
are unpredictable and often our technological advancements are not enough. 
         
Despite modern earthquake resistant techniques that are now used by law in many countries globally, they can’t protect against 
all factors of an earthquake. In Christchurch, New Zealand modern buildings that were recently constructed and had abided by
the earthquake building regulation still didn’t survive the earthquake that occurred. John Clague, a natural Hazard expert,
Simon Fraser University said, “it is unclear what caused such serious damage to modern buildings, but the answer could be liquefaction.”
The uncertainty in what caused such significant damage raises the question if our new advanced technologies are reliable enough against 
the protection of earthquake impacts.However, despite past events new innovations are occurring which can be used to prevent the 
damage which results from liquefaction. 

Liquefaction is where is the soil has a low density near the surface of the e ground loses
stability due to and earthquakes ground shaking and mimics the properties of water. 
There are three main methods to help reduce liquefaction include: ground improvement techniques, reinforcement methods and soil
treatment methods. Geotechnic engineering has been the main drive behind the spoilation for the prevention of liquefaction. By
increasing the density of the soil, the overall strength is greater this the means that there is a greater resistant against liquefaction.


A 70-story building in Japan, due to Japan’s excessive number of earthquakes that occur a year a building with a height at this 
scale can be risky and dangerous without the proper techniques in place to protect the structure from high amounts of seismic activity.
To absorb the force of an earthquake the Yokohama tower has a flexible structure. This means the base of the structure is to be built
separated slightly to the rest of the structure. The Yokohama tower is built with a 5m slab which controls the movement of the building 
during ground shaking. It reinforces the structure keeping the base sturdy. It also allows the building to move in the opposing direction 
to the force of the earthquake keeping the building standing. 
The Yokohama uses techniques that have also been used on ancient wooden temples. The solid base and flexible structure have been used 
for over 100 of years in Japan. The fact this technique is still used in modern day infrastructure implies how reliable of a mechanism
it is when protecting infrastructure against seismic activity. 

To conclude the modern advancements in earthquake technology are mostly reliable in protecting infrastructure against earthquakes. 
Although some techniques show faults or may not protect against all impacts and threats posed by earthquakes,
by combining methods most of the infrastructure can be heavily armoured against the forces of an earthquake. 
This limits the weaknesses which can then be exposed the only remaining unreliability is how unpredictable natural hazards can 
be and being prepared for all impacts poses a difficult and expensive task. By using the techniques which are proven to have the
most proception we can increase the reliability of the techniques used.
