  this article focuses on the variance in techniques used to prevent damage to infrastructure during natural hazards 
  such as earthquakes. The differences in the techniques and which one has the most successful and beneficial outcome 
  for the cause. Focus on how these mechanisms function to keep a building standing during an earthquake.

earthquakes can happen at many magnitudes, and some can be extremely damaging to infrastructure. Techniques have been 
put in place which can help the building withstand the force of an earthquake. However, some techniques are more efficient 
than others and use different mechanisms to keep a building stable. New and advanced earthquake resistant technologies tend 
to be expensive, and countries of greater wealth are usually able to invest in this technology. They are heavily used in countries 
such as Japan and China where earthquakes are quite frequent, and countries are wealthy enough to afford this technology.

A range of techniques are usually used at a time to porrect against various impacts caused by an earthquake. 
Two important techniques that are used: Base isolation, energy dissipation devices. Both techniques are commonly used as a strategy.
Base isolation: a series of bearing pads which are situated between the building itself and the foundations on which they sit. 
Bearing pads are sturdy in the vertical direction but leave room for movement in the horizontal direction. In the event of an earthquake 
the building can then move with the earthquake rather than against it.
Energy dissipation: energy gained by the building from the earthquake is dissipated through damping. Although the infrastructure can 
dissipate some energy on its own its capacity isn’t high enough and the building will collapse. To solve this, extra elements such as beams
and columns are added. 
A wide range of dissipators have been developed, friction damps, metallic dampers, viscoelastic dampers, viscous dampers. Having a range of 
dampers can be beneficial as they act to different scenarios so using a diverse mix can increase the amount of energy dissipated making it 
more effective overall.
These two techniques are heavily relied upon in protecting a countries infrastructure from natural hazards. However, hazards are 
unpredictable and often our technological advancements are not enough. 
Despite modern earthquake resistant techniques that are now used by law in many countries globally, they can’t protect against all 
factors of an earthquake. In Christchurch, New Zealand modern buildings that were recently constructed and had abided by the earthquake 
building regulation still didn’t survive the earthquake that occurred. John Clague, a natural Hazard expert, Simon Fraser University 
said, “it is unclear what caused such serious damage to modern buildings, but the answer could be liquefaction.”
The uncertainty in what caused such significant damage raises the question if our new advanced technologies are reliable enough 
against the protection of earthquake impacts. The research conducting into liquefaction is limited as 


A 70-story building in Japan, due to Japan’s excessive number of earthquakes that occur a year a building with a height at this scale can be risky and dangerous without the proper techniques in place to protect the structure from high amounts of seismic activity. To absorb the force of an earthquake the Yokohama tower has a flexible structure. This means the base of the structure is to be built separated slightly to the rest of the structure. The Yokohama tower is built with a 5m slab which controls the movement of the building during ground shaking. It reinforces the structure keeping the base sturdy. It also allows the building to move in the opposing direction to the force of the earthquake keeping the building standing. 
The Yokohama uses techniques that have also been used on ancient wooden temples. The solid base and flexible structure have been used for over 100 of years in Japan. The fact this technique is still used in modern day infrastructure implies how reliable of a mechanism it is when protecting infrastructure against seismic activity. 
 
To conclude the modern advancements in earthquake technology are mostly reliable in protecting infrastructure against earthquakes. Although some techniques show faults or may not protect against all impacts and threats posed by earthquakes, by combining methods most of the infrastructure can be heavily armoured against the forces of an earthquake. The only remaining unreliability is how unpredictable natural hazards can be and being prepared for all impacts poses a difficult and expensive task. By using the techniques which are proven to have the most proception we can increase the reliability of the techniques used.
